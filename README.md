Yes, this is indeed a backport of Jappa's (and my and others') textures to Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. Super hostile is still fun, OK?

This will download the latest version of this repo for you and can be used directly in Minecraft

## Installation:

In the Minecraft *main menu*, select "Mods and Texture Packs" → "" → "Open Texture Packs Folder" and paste the downloaded .zip file in

## Credits:

Most resources are from CyanideX's Unity Resource Pack *or* Jappa's new 1.14 Resources, that have been backported using a customized Java-made tool. A few are even made by myself!
